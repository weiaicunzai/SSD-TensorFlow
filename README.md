# TensorFlow-VGG

This is a TensorFlow version implemenation of VGG network, the purpose of this
repo is to pratice how to use TensorFlow.

## Abstruct
I was going to use TensorFlow's low level api to implement this VGG network, but
after I looking into the low level api, I've found that low level api is not that
easy to use, therefore I decided to use TensorFlow's high level api tensorflow.python.keras
as my main high level TensorFlow api for daily development. As for the low level api, 
my goal now is to simply understand what these low apis do.

## Requirement
TensorFlow 1.4
Python 3.5

## Things that I want to know about tf.keras API

- Data preprocessing
- How to Train a model
- How to use Tensorboard to debug network(basic functions)
